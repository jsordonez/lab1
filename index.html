<p style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.7);"><br>I am Juan Agustin Ordoñez, people call me Justin. I was born from Naga City but I grew up in Metro Manila.</br> 
<br>I live with my parents and with my only sibling. I took my elementary and high school at Don Bosco Manila and Don Bosco Technical College in Mandaluyong.</br>
<br>I’ve been very active with school activities and extracurricular activities in elementary and high school. </br>
<br>My favorite subject was math and I used to be a representative of our school in math conventions during my elementary days.</br> 
<br>I was once a plus-size kid who later then joined the basketball varsity team in high school. My body shaped better than ever before and with all the hard work</br> <br> I stepped up my game and joined the college basketball varsity team during my senior high school years.</br><br>When I reached college, since there were no varsity programs offered by the school I focused on playing mobile games. </br><br>Speaking of college, the first course which I should’ve been enrolled was BS in Marine Transportation which was chosen by my parents.</br><br> The second course was my personal choice, BS in Multimedia Arts but I thought about the opportunities.</br><br> That’s why I end up in BS in Information Technology which I also desire and find it wise.</br></p>
